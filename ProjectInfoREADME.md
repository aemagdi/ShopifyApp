# ShopifyApp

This app was created by Ann Mohamed, Mina Ezzat, and myself Abdelrahman Magdy. This was our graduation project from the Institute of Information Technology Institute (ITI) 3-months program to become an iOS Developer. 
The main repo created during the execution project was on Mina's account in this link https://github.com/MeNa619493/ShopifyApp/tree/FinalProject.

I hope you like this project and if you have any comments or questions, don't hesitate to contact me @ https://www.linkedin.com/in/aemagdi/

Thank you,

Abdelrahman
